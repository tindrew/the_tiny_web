# The Tiny Web

The Tiny Web will be a small blogging platform focused on the words, the writing. Minimalism, working well on any browser, and accessibility will be the foundation it is built on. 

The Tiny Web will operate on a freemium model, free to write text blogs with a subdomain(yourblog.thetinyweb.com), or a very small monthly fee for a custom domain and some other features that will cost me the most to provide.
